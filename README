# OpenSSL support for EiffelNet #

Status: suspended not-working linux-only

This code is the result of an old patch from Guus Leeuw jr.  (from itpassion.com)
updated by Jocelyn Fiat to void-safety and provided as an extension to EiffelNet.

This supports only Linux so far
And in latest try on ubuntu, we had C compilation error 
"undefined reference to `SSLv2_client_method' "

This "project" is open for contribution, and looking for maintainer.
